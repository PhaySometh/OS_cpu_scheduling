# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This repository contains a Java-based CPU Scheduling Simulator that implements four common scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT), and Round Robin (RR). The simulator allows users to input process details (arrival time and burst time) and visualize the scheduling results, including Gantt charts, waiting times, turnaround times, and their averages.

## Features
- Interactive menu-driven interface to select scheduling algorithms.
- Input validation for number of processes, arrival times, burst times, and time quantum.
- Generation of Gantt charts to visualize process execution order.
- Calculation and display of waiting times, turnaround times, and their averages for each process.
- Support for multiple scheduling algorithms with different strategies.

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line compiler (e.g., `javac`).
